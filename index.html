      We are a team of like minded people who share information for Indians planning
      to move abroad. In different articles we share tips for preparing to move,
      different things to consider before moving and all other related things.
      Our team comprises all types of people, some have moved and settled abroad,
      some decided to not go out and some initially went but then came back to their
      country. So you will get a balanced view from all the information from different
      people and then can decide what's best for yourself.
