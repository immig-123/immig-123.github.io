        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
        In this article we cover the importance of English tests and things to consider before
        appearing for it. The english language skills are deficient in most people from Indian 
        subcontinent. But It's the only factor in point based migration which is in our control.
        So most people try to score well in this test and hope that they will be able to reach 
        required points.
      </p>
      <h3>Find your target</h3>
      <p>
        But before you consider appearing for a test, it is important to calculate your points
        and find out what score you need to get an invitation. There are a number of countries
        who ask for English tests. Some of them are Canada, UK, USA, Australia, Singapore,
        NewZealand, Philippines, Thailand, Hongkong etc. The general trend is that people 
        from northern states like Punjab, Haryana prefer to move to Canada where as people from south 
        prefer UK, Australia or even USA. For all of these destinations one needs to prove
        English proficiency. So for many of us the first hurdle is to score well in English 
        tests. The minimum point cut off required has consistently increased over the last 
        few years. For example as of writing this article you need around 470 for Canada and
        around 95  for Australia. So it's important to do your calculations and find out if you
        can get the required points from english test as per your abilities. Don't
        waste your valuable time and money in these tests if you can't have minimum points. That time and 
        money can be better spent on other useful tasks in life.
      </p>
      <h3>Find your Test</h3>
      <p>
        In case you find that you can get the needed points by scoring well then you should 
        start preparing for the test. Now, you need to choose the type of test you want to take.
         There are many types of English tests which one can appear to prove their skills. 
         For example IELTS, TOEFL, CAE, PTE, OET are few of them. It also depends upon the 
         country you are applying for and if you want to go for academics or general migration. 
         The IELTS academics test works both for students and general so that also should be 
         considered.
      </p>
      <h3>Test Types</h3>
      <p>
        The most popular and straightforward test is IELTS. This is the most popular choice 
        because it has been widely tested and adopted as an accurate measure of english ability.
        It also doesn't deducts any points for accent which makes it useful for Indians. Another
        positive thing is that you can have the option to choose between computer based and 
        paper based depending upon your strengths. There are many centres available all over 
        India so you can find one close to your home. It is accepted by almost all english 
        speaking countries and over 9000 universities. There is a lot of preparatory material
        available online. For other tests, especially PTE there is shortage of free material 
        and test centres are also scarce. The second most popular is the TOEFL test
        which is also widely accepted by top universities and many countries. Many candidates
        try TOEFL if they are unable to score well in IELTS. Some people find TOEFL better 
        suited to their skills. PTE being a fully computer based test is considered 
        unreliable. The score highly depends upon how well you can listen to and speak in proper
        english accent and your pronunciation. Once you have worked out the
        test, it's time to forget everything to put all your energy and focus in 
        preparation. It's not an easy test especially for Asians and so requires serious preparation. Most
        people are able to do well after around an year of serious preparation so be prepared commit to it for long term.
        Many people take it easy and expect immediate results which leads to dissatisfaction. Think of this test just like 
        other competetive exams in India like UPSC, GATE, CAT or banking etc.
        
      </p>
      <h3>Other Important Things</h3>
      <p>
        On the other hand if your calculations indicate that you will fall short of required points
        even if you score well in English then also you don't need to worry about anything. In today's world, most of the 
        things can be achieved by investing two things - <b>time and money</b>. 
        Don't waste your valuable time and money unnecessarily on tests in this case. 
        You should think practically and focus on other important things you can achieve. 
        People move abroad for better life and money but both of these can be earned in India 
        as well. For example you can do certifications and courses to enhance your skills and 
        resume. You can consider masters or MBA from good institutions to give your career a 
        boost. There is a thriving startup culture in Indian cities. So think of a business idea 
        and give it a try. Think of starting a small business. The opportunities are <b>endless</b> if 
        you have an open mind. And it's cheaper,easier and more feasible to try all these experiments in India 
        than other countries. All major MNCs have their centres in India so there is no shortage 
        of engineering jobs. Many people move abroad through their companies. The cities in India now have world class facilities. So you don't 
        really lose anything even if you can't move out to other countries. It's all about making 
        a plan to grow your career. India being a developing country, the opportunities are even 
        more here compared to developed countries like Canada, USA or Australia which all are 
        struggling with recession in recent years. If you look at any indian city and you will 
        find so many people living a luxurious life that is impossible in other countries.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        In the end it's all about living your life satisfactorily and making a realistic plan to achieve that. 
        So find out if you really want to move abroad. If yes and if you can have required points 
        then choose an english test and prepare hard for it. But if you don't have required points 
        then also there is no reason to feel sad. Since our aim is to live a good life, that is very 
        much possible in India too. You need to be positive and look at how you can enhance your career. 
        Make a plan, stick to it and then you can be as successful in your own country as outside. 
        And you don't have to leave the place you call <b>home</b>!
