        In this article we cover the importance of English tests and things to consider before
         appearing for it. The english language skills are deficient in most people from Indian 
         subcontinent. But It's the only factor in point based migration which is in our control.
          So most people try to score well in this test and hope that they will get the required
           points.
      </p>
      <p>
        But before you consider appearing for a test, it is important to calculate your points
         and find out what score you need to get an invitation. There are a number of countries
          who ask for English tests. Some of them are Canada, UK, USA, Australia, Singapore,
           NewZealand, Philippines, Thailand, Hongkong etc. The general trend is that people 
           from northern states like Punjab prefer to move to Canada where as people from south 
           prefer UK, Australia or even USA. For all of these destinations one needs to prove
            English proficiency. So for many of us the first hurdle is to score well in English 
            tests. The minimum point cut off required has consistently increased over the last 
            few years. For example as of writing this article you need 470 for Canada and 95 
            for Australia. So it's important to do your calculations and find if you can get 
            the required points when you achieve the best score as per your abilities. Don't
             waste your valuable time in tests if you can't have minimum points. That time and 
             money can be better spent on other useful tasks in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case you find that you can get the needed points by scoring well then you should 
        start preparing for the test. Now, you need to choose the type of test you want to take.
         There are many types of English tests which one can appear to prove their skills. 
         For example IELTS, TOEFL, CAE, PTE, OET are few of them. It also depends upon the 
         country you are applying for and if you want to go for academics or general migration. 
         The IELTS academics test works both for students and general so that also should be 
         considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most popular and straightforward test is IELTS. This is the most popular choice 
        because it has been widely tested and adopted as an accurate measure of english ability.
        It also doesn't deducts any points for accent which makes it useful for Indians. Another
        positive thing is that you can have the option to choose between computer based and 
        paper based depending upon your strengths. There are many centres available all over 
        India so you can find one close to your home. It is accepted by almost all english 
        speaking countries and over 9000 universities. There is a lot of preparatory material
        available online. For other tests, especially PTE there is shortage of free material 
        and test centres are also in less cities. The second most popular is the TOEFL test
        which is also widely accepted by top universities and many countries. Many candidates
        try TOEFL if they are unable to score well in IELTS. Some people find TOEFL better 
        suited to their skills. PTE being a fully computer based test is considered 
        unreliable. The score highly depends upon how well you can listen to english accent,
        speak in the proper accent and your pronunciation. Once you have worked out the
        test, it's time to forget everything to put all your energy and focus in 
        preparation. It's not an easy test for Indians and so requires serious preparation. Most
        people are able to do well after around an year of serious preparation so it will be significant
        investment of your time.

        On the other hand if you are falling short of required points even if you score well in English then also you don't need to worry about anything. In today's world, most of the things can be achieved by sacrificing two things - time and money. Don't waste your valuable time and money unnecessarily on tests in this case. You should focus on other things you can achieve. People move abroad for better life and money but both of these can be earned in India as well. For example you can do certifications and courses to enhance your skills and resume. You can also consider masters or MBA from good institutions to give your career a boost. There is a thriving startup culture in Indian cities. So think of a business idea and give it a try. Think of starting a small business. The opportunities are endless if you have an open mind. And it's cheaper to try all these things, do experiments in India than other countries. All major MNCs have their centres in India so there is no shortage of engineering jobs. The cities in India now have world class facilities. So you don't really lose anything even if you can't move out to other countries. It's all about making a plan to grow your career. India being a developing country, the opportunities are even more here compared to developed countries like Canada, USA or Australia which all are struggling with recession in recent years. If you look at any indian city and you will find so many people living a luxurious life that is impossible in other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end it's all about living your life satisfactorily and making a realistic plan. So find out if you really want to move abroad. If yes and if you can have required points then choose an english test and prepare hard for it. But if you don't have required points then also there is no reason to feel sad. Since our aim is to live a good life, that is very much possible in India too. You need to be positive and look at how you can enhance your career. Make a plan, stick to it and then you can be as successful in your own country as outside. And you don't need to leave the place you call home!
